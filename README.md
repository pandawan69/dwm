# dwm
This is my personal build of dwm. I've added some the following patches:

- attachbelow
- bar height
- barpadding
- center
- cyclelayouts
- fakefullscreen
- noborder
- ru gaps

Besides that, I've also implemented a little left-padding on the window title. There are also some themes on the `config.h` file, but you can also choose to use [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) integration.
